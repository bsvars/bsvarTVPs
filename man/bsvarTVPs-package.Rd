\title{Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressions with Time-Varying Identification}
\description{
Efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural 
Vector Autoregressions (VARs) with Stochastic Volatility heteroskedasticity, 
Markov-switching and Time-Varying Identification of the Structural Matrix, 
and a three-level global-local hierarchical prior shrinkage for the 
structural and autoregressive matrices. The models were developed for a paper 
by Camehl & Woźniak (2023) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2311.05883>. The 'bsvarTVPs' 
package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the 
R packages 'bsvars' by Woźniak (2024) <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvars> and 
'bsvarSIGNs' by Wang & Woźniak (2024) <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvarSIGNs>, 
and they constitute an integrated toolset.

\details{
All the SVAR models in this package are specified by two equations, including 
the reduced form equation:
\deqn{Y = AX + E}
where \eqn{Y} is an \code{NxT} matrix of dependent variables, 
\eqn{X} is a \code{KxT} matrix of explanatory variables, 
\eqn{E} is an \code{NxT} matrix of reduced form error terms, 
and \eqn{A} is an \code{NxK} matrix of autoregressive slope coefficients and 
parameters on deterministic terms in \eqn{X}.

The structural equation is given by:
\deqn{B(s_t, kappa(s_t))E = U}
where \eqn{U} is an \code{NxT} matrix of structural form error terms, and
\eqn{B} is an \code{NxN} matrix of contemporaneous relationships.

Finally, all of the models share the following assumptions regarding the structural
shocks \code{U}, namely, joint conditional normality given the past observations collected
in matrix \code{X}, and temporal and contemporaneous independence. The latter implies 
zero correlations and autocorrelations.
